```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
dataset_Facebook <- read_csv("~/Projects/dataset_Facebook.csv")
View(dataset_Facebook)
```

```{r dataset_Facebook}
capstone <- dataset_Facebook
```
Getting a feel for the data.
```{r}
head(capstone)
dim(capstone)

lapply(capstone, class)

summary (capstone)
```
Cleaning the data, and getting rid of the NAs
```{r}
capstone <- na.omit(capstone)
which(is.na(capstone),arr.ind = TRUE)
```
Preprocessing..
```{r}
library(caret)
preProcValues <- preProcess(capstone, method = c("center", "scale"))
```
I'll be fixing this up soon.
```{r}
ggplot(capstone, aes(x =`Post Month`, y =`Post Weekday`, col = Paid )) + geom_histogram()

trying to see which month and days were correlated with getting paid
plot(capstone$`Post Month`,capstone$`Post Weekday`, col = capstone$Paid)
plot(capstone$`Post Weekday`,capstone$`Post Month`, col = capstone$Paid)

breaking it down to the hour
plot(capstone$`Post Hour`,capstone$`Post Weekday`, col = capstone$Paid)

Just using total likes as a base for getting paid from either: comment, like or share.
plot(capstone$`Page total likes`,capstone$comment, col = capstone$Paid)
plot(capstone$`Page total likes`,capstone$like, col = capstone$Paid)
plot(capstone$`Page total likes`,capstone$share, col = capstone$Paid)

```
